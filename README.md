## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture & Optimization Strategy

### **Stakeholder-Segmented Dataset Design**

After completing comprehensive analysis, I designed a **7-dataset architecture** that transforms complex findings into purpose-built, stakeholder-optimized data products:

#### **1. Master Fact Table: `autodesk_master_usage_data.csv`**
*955,033 records | Complete dimensional model*

**Why Created:** Stakeholders need drill-down capability from insights to account details
**Optimization Decisions:**
- Performance flags: `HighPerformer`, `AtRisk`, `ExpansionCandidate` for instant filtering
- Calculated fields: Pre-computed `UnusedSeats`, `UnassignedSeats` avoid runtime calculations
- Date intelligence: Split Month into Year/MonthNum for proper hierarchy
- Business-friendly naming: PascalCase, no underscores for Power BI best practices

#### **2. Executive Summary: `autodesk_regional_summary.csv`**
*6 regions | Pre-aggregated for C-level dashboards*

**Why Created:** 21.8-point regional gap requires executive attention
**Strategic Fields:**
- Performance rankings: `AssignmentRateRank`, `UtilizationRateRank`
- Market context: `MarketShareBySeats` vs performance correlation
- Risk indicators: `AtRiskRate` by region for intervention prioritization

#### **3. Segmentation Insights: `autodesk_sizeband_analysis.csv`**
*8 size bands | Enterprise crisis focus*

**Why Created:** Counterintuitive finding - largest customers show worst performance
**Analytical Enhancements:**
- Revenue vs performance: `RevenueContribution` vs `AvgUtilizationRate` reveals ROI crisis
- Complexity indicator: `PerformanceGap` highlights enterprise deployment challenges
- Sorting logic: `SizeBandOrder` ensures proper visualization progression

#### **4. Lifecycle Intelligence: `autodesk_tenure_analysis.csv`**
*9 tenure segments | Customer journey optimization*

**Why Created:** New customers outperform veterans by 14 points
**Journey Mapping Fields:**
- Lifecycle classification: `LifecycleStage` groups quarters into business phases
- Trajectory analysis: `TenureOrder` enables chronological visualization
- Intervention targeting: Veteran customer re-engagement opportunity quantified

#### **5. Strategic Decision Support: `autodesk_risk_opportunity_matrix.csv`**
*5 performance categories | Predictive customer success*

**Why Created:** Usage patterns correlate with revenue performance
**Predictive Analytics Fields:**
- Business signal classification: Growth vs Risk categories
- Early warning system: AtRiskRate establishes intervention thresholds
- Resource allocation: `PriorityOrder` guides customer success focus

#### **6. Time-Series Analysis: `autodesk_monthly_trends.csv`**
*24 month-region combinations | Trend identification*

**Why Created:** Track improvement against established baselines
**Trend Analytics:**
- Efficiency tracking: `UtilizationEfficiency` shows regional trajectories
- Risk monitoring: `AtRiskRate` trending identifies deteriorating regions
- Seasonal patterns: Month-over-month analysis capability

#### **7. Executive KPI Tracking: `autodesk_overall_monthly_trends.csv`**
*4 months | C-level performance monitoring*

**Why Created:** Board-level reporting requires simple APAC narrative
**Executive Metrics:**
- Change indicators: `AssignmentRateChange`, `UtilizationRateChange`
- Baseline comparison: Track against 92.9%/74.0% benchmarks
- Performance velocity: Month-over-month acceleration patterns
